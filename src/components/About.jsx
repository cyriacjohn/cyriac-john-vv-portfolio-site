            I hold a BTECH degree in Computer Science from Central University of Kerala, equipping me with strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for building dynamic websites. I'm also a proficient designer, using Photoshop to create visuals like brochures, logos, posters, and templates, which adds a creative touch to my work.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className='text-xl'>I'm an active contributor in various communities, fostering collaboration and insightful discussions. Notably, I collaborated with Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) on a project, designing badges, ID cards, posters, and banners that beautifully blend technology and design.</p>
            <br />
            <p className='text-xl'>What sets me apart is my genuine passion for both designing and coding.
